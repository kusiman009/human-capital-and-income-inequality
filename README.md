Abstract
        
      This paper analyzes the relationship between human capital, gender inequality, and GDP on income inequality in seven regions with varying income levels. Panel data from 125 countries spanning from 2000 to 2018 is used, and various techniques, including Panel Spatial Correlation Consistent dummy variables (PSCC) and panel quantile regression, are employed. The results show that income level plays a significant role in the relationship between human capital and income inequality on GDP. Political stability and total population have a positive impact on GDP across all income groups, while gender inequality has a negative impact on GDP in high-income countries but a positive impact in low-income countries.
The study also examines the correlation between Gini coefficient as a measure of income inequality and the Gender Inequality Index (GII). The results show a positive correlation between the lagged Gini variable and its present values, indicating that past values of Gini coefficient influenced its present values. Additionally, the GII is positively associated with the Gini coefficient.
The findings suggest that policymakers can implement policies aimed at reducing income inequality through progressive taxation, social welfare programs, and labor market regulations to promote economic growth. Policies aimed at reducing gender inequality can also have an impact on income inequality and GDP. This study provides insights into the complex relationship between income inequality, gender inequality, under 5 mortality rate and GDP, which policymakers can use to design policies that promote sustainable economic growth and reduce income and gender inequality.
